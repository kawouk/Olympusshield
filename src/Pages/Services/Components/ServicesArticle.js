                What is a Penetration Test?
                </h2>
                <p className='services-article-description'>
                Penetration Test, also known as "Offensive Security" is the process of imitating real-life electronic attacks (be it remote or local) against the client for the sole purpose of detecting vulnerabilities and possible active exploitations of the client's network to provide the client with a fully detailed report, technical and narrative, describing the findings and recommending the most effective remediation and mitigation for every detected vulnerability; Once the patching is complete on the client's side, it is the duty of the penetration tester to re-assess the security state of the targeted network to make sure all vulnerabilities are properly mitigated and no new vulnerabilities have been accidentally created in the process.
                </p>
                <h3 className='services-article-title'>Why is Penetration Test Necessary?</h3>
                <p className='services-article-description'>
                Since we live in a world built on Data flows and Data processing, and since every business and company relies on its Data to properly run their operations and keep their privacy and the privacy of their clients intact, any breach or infiltration against any layer of the client's online presence poses a huge risk against the client's reputation and threatens to completely disrupt the targeted business and even completely wipe off any hacked database or application (be it web or local), and since such risks can ONLY be detected by Offensive Penetration Test, imitating real-life attacks using the most advanced techniques known to hackers, Penetration Tests have become a necessity to any business, company, data center, or even an online shop or email relay, to detect and mitigate the client's exploitability before it becomes known to black-hat hackers who will not hesitate to infiltrate their target and cause as much damage as it is in their capabilities, stealing as much as possible in the process for their own personal profit.
                </p>
                <h3 className='services-article-title'>Types of Penetration Tests</h3>
                <p className='services-article-description'>
                Penetration Tests are mainly divided into two main categories, each is divided into three paths.
                </p>
                <ol className='pen-types-list'>
                    <li className='pen-type-list-item'>Cyber/Remote Penetration Test
                    <ol className='pen-box-list'>
                            <li className='pen-box-list-item'>Blackbox.</li>
                            <li className='pen-box-list-item'>Greybox.</li>
                            <li className='pen-box-list-item'>Whitebox.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li className='pen-type-list-item'>Local Penetration Test
                        <ol className='pen-box-list'>
                            <li className='pen-box-list-item'>Blackbox.</li>
                            <li className='pen-box-list-item'>Greybox.</li>
                            <li className='pen-box-list-item'>Whitebox.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p className='services-article-description'>
                    While a Cyber/Remote Penetration Test will target the client's online presence through their Public IP, Host, Website, Web Application, Mail Relay, Online Backup... or any platform used by the client to run their business and operations over the internet; Local Penetration Test will target the client's local network and infrastructure hitting every device owned and operating for the client on every possible layer, be it Network Layer Attacks or OS Layer Attacks.
                    Blackbox, Greybox, and Whitebox are similar in both categories and completely depend on the privilege granted by the client to the Penetration Tester.
                </p>



                
                <h3 className='services-article-title'>How is Local Penetration Test Performed</h3>
                <p className='services-article-description'>
                A local Penetration Test is when the tester plugs into the local network/infrastructure of the client and performs many steps which will be described below to make sure any active exploitation is detected and disabled and every vulnerability is identified, reported, and mitigated.
                </p>
                <p className='services-article-description'>
                    A Local Penetration Test should be run manually and through automated engines since each has its own benefits.
                </p>
                <p className='services-article-description'>
                    While Automated engines will save time, the cost is the accuracy of the tests.
                </p>
                <p className='services-article-description'>
                    Hence, manual attacks will sweep through every bit of the targeted network/infrastructure leaving no stone unturned, at the cost of time.
                </p>
                <p className='services-article-description'>
                    The Penetration Tester will first plug his device into the targeted network or infrastructure and will run an automated script first that will scan all the connected devicesâ€™ ports ranging from 1 to 65535 and detect all open ports then identify the services running within each port and then the Penetration Tester will manually attempt to infiltrate each device using either well-known vulnerabilities or zero-days discovered on the spot. The Penetration Tester is also expected to detect, report, and disable any active exploitation, backdoor, or any malicious activity detected in the process.
                </p>
                <h6 className='services-article-sub-title'>Local Network Attacks are mainly as follows:</h6>

                <p className='services-article-description'>
                The Penetration Tester is then expected to provide the client with an accurate and precise report explaining every attack performed on the network along with POC of any successful attack and malicious detection. The Provided report must contain a technical part explaining the entire technical process of the whole Penetration Test performed on-site, a narrative part explaining the whole operation to any non-technical person involved in the hierarchy of the client, a remediation and recommendation part, and finally, it is the Penetration Tester's duty to provide a re-assessment to the client whenever the client notifies that his patching is completely done to make sure that all the addressed vulnerabilities have been fixed, all malicious activities have been disabled, and no new vulnerabilities have been generated in the patching process.
